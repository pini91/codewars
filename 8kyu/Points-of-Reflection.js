// "Point reflection" or "point symmetry" is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.

// Task
// Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is a two-element array of integers representing the point's X and Y coordinates. Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.

// This kata was inspired by the Hackerrank challenge Find Point

function symmetricPoint(p, q) {
//formula: refp(a)=2p-a

let x = 2*q[0]-p[0]
let y = 2*q[1]-p[1]
return[x,y]
  
}

console.log(symmetricPoint([2, 6], [-2, -6]))
