// In this kata we have to create a function that will give us some specific information of a data base. We have a sequence of postive integers that is registered by OEIS with the code 001055. This sequence give us the amount of ways that a number may be expressed as a product of its factors (including the number itself multiplied by one.)

// The first terms of this sequence are shown below:

// n-th term    a(n)
// 1             1
// 2             1
// 3             1
// 4             2
// 5             1
// 6             2
// 7             1
// 8             3
// 9             2
// 10            2
// 11            1
// 12            4
// 13            1
// 14            2
// 15            2
// 16            5
// In the preloaded section you are given a hash table named A001055 (Python and JavaScript) or $a001055 (Ruby), where keys are the numbers from 1 to 1006, and the values are the respective terms of the aforementioned sequence.

// You have to create the function that receives three arguments:

// An array with 2 elements that represent the numbers in range [a, b] to be considered.
// A string with five possible valid values: "equals to", "higher than", "lower than", "higher and equals to", and "lower and equals to" (any other value is considered invalid).
// The element of the A001055 sequence.
// The function should return the amount of numbers that fulfill our conditions and a sorted list of these numbers.

// Examples
// We want to know about the numbers between 10 and 21 (included) that have more than 1 multiplicative partition:
// range = [10, 21]
// str = "higher than"
// val = 1

// result = (8, [10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21])
// We want to know the numbers between 25 and 75 that have more than or equals to 5 multiplicative partitions:
// range = [25, 75]
// str = "higher and equals to"
// val = 5

// result = (13, [30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 70, 72])
// If the string command is wrong, the function will return "wrong constraint":
// range = [25, 75]
// str = "qwerty"
// val = 5

// result = "wrong constraint"
// Enjoy it!!
